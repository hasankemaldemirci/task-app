- A simple task manager written in Node.Js for learning purposes.
- Includes file uploads, email sending, CI, Testing with jest, Slack integrations and user profiles.

## tests
- Test cases are a bit overkill.
- For learning and practicing, I tried to write as many tests as possible.

## env files
You can always check `.env.example` file to see which env variables you need.
- Create env files in root directory or modify your scripts to run them properly.
- Create `.env.test` file to setup env variables for tests.
- Create `.env.development` file to setup env variables for development server and database.
